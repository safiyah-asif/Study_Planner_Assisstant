# Problem Statement

## User

Students who struggle to organize their study time efficiently without wasting their time.

## Pain Point

- They don’t know how to break goals into daily tasks.
- They overestimate/underestimate required time.
- Planning across weeks is confusing.
- They can have a personal assistant which can help them for planning their schedule.

## Why It Matters

Effective study planning reduces stress, improves productivity, manage time and increases exam success rates.

## MVP Goal

Build a minimal AI-powered study planner that:

- Takes a goal (project/exam/course)
- Collects topics and difficulty
- Collects available hours
- Produces a weekly or 2 weeks study plan

## Scope (In Scope)

- User inputs (goal, topics, hours)
- AI-assisted hour allocation
- Single-user workflow
- Simple schedule generation

## Out of Scope

- Calendar integrations (Google/Outlook)
- Notifications or reminders
- Advanced AI reasoning
- Multi-user system
- SubTopics
- Flexible timelines (2 days/ 1 month)
- Revision Points

## Assumptions

- User inputs accurate study hours
- Topic difficulty correlates with required time
- User studies only one major goal at a time
